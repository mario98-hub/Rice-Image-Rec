# Rice-Image-Rec
CNN and Transfer Learning for image recognition


To develop the project we use the dataset available on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset. The dataset is called *Rice Image Dataset*. It contains 75K images including 15K images for each rice variety that are: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag.

We decide to use the dataset to solve a **classification problem**. We want to find a performing deep learning model to correctly classify 5 types of rice.

We mainly use two approaches:

*  **Convolutional Neaural Network from scratch**
*  **Transfer learning and Fine Tuning and feature extraction**

In the first case we design a new architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch. 

In the second case we use completely a Pre-trained Neural Network adding a Feed-Forward Neural Network to improve the performances.  

Neural networks with the best performances are presented in this notebook.

***Notebook 1*** and ***Notebook 2*** contain all the attempts.
